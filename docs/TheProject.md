# [The Project]

The Project, as a foundation, introduces Python's modular programming
building blocks (modules, packages (including namespace packages) and
explains Python's runtime mechanics of ingesting (importing) those
building blocks. Based on that foundation, the tutorial offers a
reasoned (opinionated!) way to structure a Python project's modular
source and test code.

The 'reasoned' structure strives to achieve modularity goals, use sane
importation practices that avoid programmatic augmentation of sys.path
yet allow for script execution (including test code) to discover modular
packages in cogently predictable ways.

Each lesson is a branch on this archive:
